# NVH Analysis Task Report

This repository contains the complete documentation and resources for the **NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) Analysis** project focused on electric bikes. The analysis uses synthetic data generated via Python and comprehensive Power BI dashboards to explore NVH metrics across various bike manufacturers and operating conditions.

## Project Overview

![Project Architecture](https://github.com/Usama00004/NVH-Analysis-Report/blob/main/Images/architecture.jpg)

The NVH analysis evaluates noise, vibration, and harshness characteristics to identify comfort and regulatory compliance issues in electric bikes. The study involves:

- Synthetic data generation using Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `random`)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling in Power BI using Power Query (M language) and DAX
- Interactive visualizations and dashboards built with Power BI Desktop
- Online sharing of reports via Power BI Service

## Repository Contents

- `NVH_Analysis_Report.pdf` – Final detailed analysis report (LaTeX compiled PDF)
- `images` – Contain images used in project
- `data/` – Folder containing synthetic data CSV files (fact and dimension tables)
- `dataproducer.py/` – Python scripts for synthetic data generation
- `04_NVH_Analysis_Report_18/` – Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file with dashboards and data models
- `README.md` – This file

## Key Features

- Star schema data modeling for efficient analysis
- Use of Power BI features: Power Query, DAX measures, slicers, drill-throughs, and bookmarks
- Synthetic data simulating multiple manufacturers, conditions, and test scenarios
- Interactive dashboards showcasing noise, vibration, and harshness insights
- Automated scheduled data refresh configured in Power BI Service

## Important Notes

- The dataset is generated randomly using a Python function for demonstration purposes.
- Metrics and trends in the report will change with each data refresh.
- The project aims to showcase data modeling, analysis, and visualization techniques for NVH data in electric bikes.
